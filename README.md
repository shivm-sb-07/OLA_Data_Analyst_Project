The OLA Data Analyst Project focuses on analyzing ride service data to derive actionable insights and present them effectively using Power BI dashboards. This project aims to enhance business decision-making by visualizing critical metrics such as ride patterns, revenue trends, customer behavior, and driver performance. The dashboards offer an interactive, real-time view of the key performance indicators (KPIs) to enable strategic planning and operational efficiency for OLA.
